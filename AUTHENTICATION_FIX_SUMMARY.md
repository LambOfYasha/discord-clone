# Authentication Fix Summary

## Issue
The user reported a `GET /api/rooms 401 in 389ms` error when accessing the rooms API endpoint.

## Root Cause
Client-side fetch requests to authenticated API routes were not including the necessary authentication credentials. In Next.js with Clerk authentication, client-side requests need to include `credentials: 'include'` to send authentication cookies.

## Solution Applied
Updated all client-side API calls to `/api/rooms` to include `credentials: 'include'` in the fetch options.

## Files Updated

### 1. `components/direct-messages/direct-messages-page-client.tsx`
- **Change**: Added `credentials: 'include'` to the fetch request
- **Impact**: Fixed the main source of the 401 error when loading the direct messages page

### 2. `components/friends/friends-sidebar.tsx`
- **Change**: Added `credentials: 'include'` to the POST request for creating DMs
- **Impact**: Fixed authentication for DM creation from friends sidebar

### 3. `components/modals/create-dm-modal.tsx`
- **Change**: Added `credentials: 'include'` to the POST request for creating DMs
- **Impact**: Fixed authentication for DM creation from the create DM modal

### 4. `components/modals/create-group-dm-modal.tsx`
- **Change**: Added `credentials: 'include'` to the POST request for creating group DMs
- **Impact**: Fixed authentication for group DM creation from the create group DM modal

### 5. `components/friends/friends-list.tsx`
- **Change**: Added `credentials: 'include'` to the POST request for creating DMs
- **Impact**: Fixed authentication for DM creation from friends list

### 6. `components/chat/chat-item.tsx`
- **Change**: Added `credentials: 'include'` to the POST request for creating DMs
- **Impact**: Fixed authentication for DM creation when clicking on chat members

### 7. `components/server/server-member.tsx`
- **Change**: Added `credentials: 'include'` to the POST request for creating DMs
- **Impact**: Fixed authentication for DM creation when clicking on server members

### 8. `components/server/server-search.tsx`
- **Change**: Added `credentials: 'include'` to the POST request for creating DMs
- **Impact**: Fixed authentication for DM creation from server search results

## Technical Details

### Before Fix
```javascript
const response = await fetch('/api/rooms', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    type: 'dm',
    targetMemberId: memberId,
  }),
});
```

### After Fix
```javascript
const response = await fetch('/api/rooms', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
  },
  credentials: 'include',
  body: JSON.stringify({
    type: 'dm',
    targetMemberId: memberId,
  }),
});
```

## Benefits
1. **Resolves 401 Errors**: All client-side requests to authenticated API routes now include proper authentication
2. **Consistent Authentication**: All components now use the same authentication pattern
3. **Better Error Handling**: Added error logging to help debug future authentication issues
4. **Maintains Security**: Authentication cookies are properly sent with each request

## Testing
The fix should resolve the `GET /api/rooms 401` error and allow the direct messages page to load properly with authenticated room data.
