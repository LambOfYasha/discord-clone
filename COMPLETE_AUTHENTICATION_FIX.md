# Complete Authentication Fix Summary

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. Server-side Fetch Calls Without Authentication
**Problem**: Server-side fetch calls in API routes don't include authentication cookies, causing 401 errors.

**Fixed in**:
- `app/api/friends/route.ts`: Replaced server-side fetch to `/api/rooms` with direct database queries
- `app/(main)/(routes)/rooms/[roomId]/page.tsx`: Replaced server-side fetch to `/api/rooms/${roomId}` with direct database queries

### 2. Client-side Fetch Calls Without Credentials
**Problem**: Client-side fetch calls weren't including authentication credentials.

**Fixed in**:
- `components/direct-messages/direct-messages-page-client.tsx`: Added `credentials: 'include'` to fetch calls
- `components/friends/friends-sidebar.tsx`: Added `credentials: 'include'` to fetch calls
- `components/modals/create-dm-modal.tsx`: Added `credentials: 'include'` to fetch calls
- `components/modals/create-group-dm-modal.tsx`: Added `credentials: 'include'` to fetch calls
- `components/friends/friends-list.tsx`: Added `credentials: 'include'` to fetch calls
- `components/chat/chat-item.tsx`: Added `credentials: 'include'` to fetch calls
- `components/server/server-member.tsx`: Added `credentials: 'include'` to fetch calls
- `components/server/server-search.tsx`: Added `credentials: 'include'` to fetch calls
- `hooks/use-chat-query.ts`: Added `credentials: 'include'` to fetch calls
- `components/chat/chat-input.tsx`: Added `withCredentials: true` to axios calls

### 3. Next.js 15 Async Params Issue
**Problem**: Next.js 15 requires params to be awaited before accessing properties.

**Fixed in**:
- `app/api/rooms/[roomId]/route.ts`: Updated all functions to await params
- `app/api/rooms/[roomId]/messages/route.ts`: Updated all functions to await params
- `app/api/rooms/[roomId]/members/route.ts`: Updated all functions to await params
- `app/api/friend-requests/[targetProfileId]/route.ts`: Updated all functions to await params
