## Technical Details

### Database Relationships
```sql
-- User follows
Profile -> Follow -> Profile (follower -> following)

-- Server follows  
Profile -> ServerFollow -> Server (follower -> server)

-- Notifications
Profile -> Notification (recipient)
Profile -> Notification (related profile)
Server -> Notification (related server)
```

### API Response Formats
```json
// Follow status check
{
  "isFollowing": true
}

// Follow list
{
  "following": [
    {
      "id": "follow-id",
      "followingProfile": {
        "id": "profile-id",
        "name": "User Name",
        "imageUrl": "https://..."
      }
    }
  ]
}

// Notifications
[
  {
    "id": "notification-id",
    "type": "FRIEND_ACTIVITY",
    "title": "New Follower",
    "content": "User started following you",
    "isRead": false,
    "createdAt": "2024-01-01T00:00:00Z",
    "relatedProfile": {...}
  }
]
```

## Testing

### Test Page
- **Location**: `/test-follow`
- **Features**: 
  - Test user follow functionality
  - Test server follow functionality
  - Real-time status updates
  - Console logging for debugging

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements
1. **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket integration for live notifications
2. **Follow Suggestions**: AI-powered friend/server recommendations
3. **Follow Analytics**: Track follow patterns and engagement

- Follow verification for high-profile users
- Follow privacy settings
- Follow blocking capabilities

## Performance Considerations

### Optimizations Implemented
- Efficient database queries with proper indexing
- Pagination for follow lists
- Caching for follow status checks
- Optimistic UI updates

### Recommended Optimizations
- Database query optimization
- Redis caching for follow status
- CDN for notification delivery
- Background job processing for notifications

## Conclusion
