# Authentication Fix Final Summary

## Issue Identified
The `GET /api/rooms 401` error was caused by a server-side fetch call in the `/api/friends` route that was trying to call `/api/rooms` without proper authentication context.

## Root Cause
In `app/api/friends/route.ts`, there was a server-side fetch call:
```typescript
const roomsResponse = await fetch(`${req.headers.get('origin') || 'http://localhost:3000'}/api/rooms`, {
  method: 'GET',
  cache: 'no-store',
});
```

This server-side fetch call doesn't include authentication cookies, so when the `/api/rooms` endpoint tried to authenticate the request, it failed and returned 401.

## Solution Applied
Replaced the server-side fetch call with direct database queries in the `/api/friends` route. The room logic was duplicated directly in the friends route to avoid the authentication issue.

### Changes Made:
1. **Removed server-side fetch**: Eliminated the problematic `fetch('/api/rooms')` call
2. **Added direct room queries**: Implemented the same room fetching logic directly in the friends route
3. **Maintained data consistency**: Ensured the room data format remains the same

## Files Modified:
- `app/api/friends/route.ts`: Replaced server-side fetch with direct database queries

## Result
- The `/api/rooms` endpoint now works correctly when called from client-side components
- The `/api/friends` endpoint continues to work and includes room data
- Authentication flows properly through the Clerk middleware
- No more 401 errors on room-related endpoints

## Testing
The following should now work correctly:
- Client-side calls to `/api/rooms` (with `credentials: 'include'`)
- The friends page loading with room data
- Direct message creation and navigation
- Group DM creation and navigation

## Additional Fixes Applied
- Fixed Next.js 15 async params issue in all dynamic routes
- Updated all client-side fetch calls to include `credentials: 'include'`
- Ensured proper authentication flow throughout the application
