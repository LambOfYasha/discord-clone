# Cleanup Summary - Rooms API Integration

## Overview
This document summarizes the cleanup performed to integrate the new unified Rooms API system, which consolidates Direct Messages (DMs) and Group DMs under a single API structure.

## Files Deleted (Redundant)

### API Routes
- `app/api/direct-messages/route.ts` - Replaced by `/api/rooms/[roomId]/messages`
- `app/api/group-messages/route.ts` - Replaced by `/api/rooms/[roomId]/messages`
- `app/api/group-conversations/route.ts` - Replaced by `/api/rooms`

### Socket Endpoints
- `pages/api/socket/direct-messages/[directMessageId].ts` - Replaced by `/pages/api/socket/rooms/[messageId].ts`
- `pages/api/socket/direct-messages/index.ts` - Replaced by `/pages/api/socket/rooms/index.ts`
- `pages/api/socket/group-messages/index.ts` - Replaced by `/pages/api/socket/rooms/index.ts`

## Files Created

### New Unified Socket Endpoints
- `pages/api/socket/rooms/index.ts` - Handles sending messages to both DMs and group conversations
- `pages/api/socket/rooms/[messageId].ts` - Handles editing and deleting messages in both DMs and group conversations

## Files Updated

### API Routes
- `app/api/friends/route.ts` - Updated to use the new `/api/rooms` endpoint instead of directly querying conversations and group conversations

### Components
- `components/direct-messages/direct-messages-page-client.tsx` - Updated to fetch and use room data from the new API

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Unified API Structure
- All room operations (DMs and Group DMs) now go through `/api/rooms`
- Dynamic routing determines if a room is a DM or group conversation
- Single endpoint for creating, reading, updating, and deleting rooms

### 2. Unified Socket System
- Single socket endpoint for real-time messaging
- Handles both DM and group message operations
- Consistent event naming (`chat:${roomId}:messages`)

### 3. Frontend Integration
- Components now fetch room data from the unified API
- Better type safety with Room interface
- Loading states for better UX

### 4. Database Integration
- Maintains existing database structure
- Uses MongoDB for message content (both DMs and groups)
- Uses PostgreSQL for room metadata and member relationships

## Benefits of Cleanup

1. **Reduced Code Duplication**: Eliminated redundant API endpoints
2. **Unified Interface**: Single API for all room operations
3. **Better Maintainability**: Easier to add new features to rooms
4. **Consistent Behavior**: Same patterns for DMs and group DMs
5. **Improved Performance**: Fewer API calls and better caching opportunities

## Migration Notes

- Existing data remains intact
- No database schema changes required
- Backward compatibility maintained through unified interface
- Socket connections automatically use new endpoints

## Testing Recommendations

1. Test DM creation and messaging
2. Test group DM creation and messaging
3. Test message editing and deletion
4. Test real-time updates via sockets
5. Test room member management
6. Test room deletion/leaving

## Future Enhancements

- Add room search functionality
- Implement room categories/folders
- Add room pinning feature
- Implement room notifications
- Add room export functionality
