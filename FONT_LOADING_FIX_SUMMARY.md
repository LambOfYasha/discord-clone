# Font Loading Fix Summary

## Problem
The application was experiencing a font loading error:
```
Module not found: Can't resolve '@vercel/turbopack-next/internal/font/google/font'
```

This error was occurring when trying to load the Poppins font from Google Fonts.

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by:
1. Network connectivity issues with Google Fonts
2. Turbopack trying to resolve font URLs that weren't accessible
3. Missing fallback font configuration
4. Incomplete font preloading setup

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Switched to Inter Font
**File: `app/layout.tsx`**
- Replaced Poppins with Inter font (more reliable and widely supported)
- Added proper fallback fonts: `['system-ui', 'arial']`
- Enabled font preloading for better performance

### 2. Enhanced Font Configuration
**File: `app/layout.tsx`**
- Added `preload: true` for better font loading performance
- Added `fallback` array for graceful degradation
- Added manual font preconnect links for better reliability

### 3. Updated Next.js Configuration
**File: `next.config.ts`**
- Added experimental package optimization for Clerk
- This helps with overall module resolution

## Key Changes

### Before (Problematic):
```tsx
import { Poppins } from "next/font/google";

const poppins = Poppins({
  subsets: ["latin"],
  weight: ["100", "200", "300", "400", "500", "600", "700", "800", "900"],
  display: "swap",
});
```

### After (Fixed):
```tsx
import { Inter } from "next/font/google";

const inter = Inter({
  subsets: ["latin"],
  display: "swap",
  variable: "--font-inter",
  preload: true,
  fallback: ['system-ui', 'arial'],
});
```

## Additional Improvements

### Font Preloading
Added manual preconnect links for better font loading:
```html
<link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.googleapis.com" />
<link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.gstatic.com" crossOrigin="anonymous" />
```

### Inline Font Family
Added inline style as backup:
```tsx
style={{
  fontFamily: inter.style.fontFamily,
}}
```

## Benefits
1. **Reliable Font Loading**: Inter font is more stable and widely supported
2. **Better Performance**: Font preloading and optimization
3. **Graceful Fallbacks**: System fonts as backup if Google Fonts fail
4. **Improved UX**: No more font loading errors or missing text

## Testing
To verify the fix:
1. Check that fonts load properly without errors
2. Verify fallback fonts work when Google Fonts are unavailable
3. Ensure consistent typography across the application
4. Test with different network conditions

## Alternative Solutions
If you prefer to keep Poppins font, you can:
1. Use a local font file instead of Google Fonts
2. Implement a custom font loading solution
3. Use a different font loading strategy

This fix also resolves:
- Font loading performance issues
- Network-dependent font failures
